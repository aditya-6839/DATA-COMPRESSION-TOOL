DESCRIPTION:
Introduction
Data compression is a fundamental technique used to reduce the size of files while maintaining their integrity. It is widely used in applications such as file storage, network transmission, and data archiving. This project aims to implement a basic Data Compression Tool using C, focusing on lossless compression techniques. The tool will allow users to compress and decompress files efficiently using algorithms like Huffman Coding or Run-Length Encoding (RLE).

Project Overview
This project provides a modular and efficient implementation of a data compression tool, capable of performing the following operations:

Compression – Reducing file size while preserving original data.
Decompression – Restoring the compressed file to its original state.
User Input Handling – Allowing users to choose between different compression methods.
File Handling – Reading and writing compressed files effectively.
The project is designed for students and developers interested in understanding how data compression works at a fundamental level.
